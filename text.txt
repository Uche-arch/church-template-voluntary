🚀 Update on our Project!

After all the late nights, stress, and endless debugging... it’s done.😅

I’ve successfully added Firebase Authentication to our platform (PropNetix)!

-- Users can now register, log in, and verify their emails.
-- Certain pages now require login to access, as real platforms do.
-- But for quick access, you can also continue as a guest. Smooth and simple.

This one took time, but I’m proud of how it turned out. We keep building. 💻🚀

Be honest... are you team "Let me explore first 👀" or "Sign me up ASAP 😏"?
