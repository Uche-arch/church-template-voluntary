              <p>
                Our purpose is to honor God by building a Christ-centered
                community where lives are transformed, disciples are raised, and
                the Gospel is boldly proclaimed. We exist to equip believers,
                reach the lost, and reflect God’s love in everything we do — in
                the church, in our city, and beyond.

                Our mission is to lead people into a growing relationship with
                Jesus Christ, equip believers for purpose-driven living, and
                raise disciples who impact their communities and the world. We
                are called to shine God's light, preach the Gospel with
                boldness, and serve with love and excellence.

              <h6>Identity in Christ</h6>

              <p>
                We believe every believer is a new creation in Christ —
                forgiven, loved, chosen, and called. Our identity is not defined
                by the world, but by who we are in Jesus. As sons and daughters
                of God, we walk in boldness, freedom, and purpose, knowing we
                are fully accepted in Him.

            <div class="column block-list__item">
              <h6>Church Is Family</h6>

              <p>
                Church is more than a building — it’s a family where everyone
                belongs. We laugh together, cry together, grow together, and
                support one another through every season of life. At Demo
                Church, you're not just a face in the crowd — you're family, and
                there's always room for you here.

            <div class="column block-list__item">
              <h6>Kingdom Culture</h6>

              <p>
                Kingdom Culture is about living with Heaven’s mindset here on
                Earth. We walk in love, integrity, honor, and bold faith —
                reflecting Christ in our actions, speech, and decisions. At Demo
                Church, we cultivate a culture where Jesus is King, people are
                valued, and the Gospel is lived out daily.

            <div class="column block-list__item">
              <h6>Spirit Led Life</h6>

              <p>
                We are called to live lives led by the Holy Spirit — walking in
                obedience, discernment, and power. At Demo Church, we teach and
                encourage believers to listen to God's voice, yield to His
                direction, and operate in the gifts and fruits of the Spirit
                daily. It's not just about moments — it's a lifestyle.

                We believe in one eternal God — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit —
                the Creator of all things. He is holy, loving, and worthy of all
                worship. Through Him, we live, move, and have our being. He is

                We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, fully God and
                fully man. He came to earth, lived a sinless life, died on the
                cross for our sins, and rose again in victory. Through Him, we
                receive salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life. He is the only
                way to the Father and will one day return in glory to reign

                We believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and
                authoritative Word of God. It is our guide for faith and life,
                revealing God’s character, promises, and purpose for humanity.
                Through Scripture, we are taught, corrected, and equipped to
                live in righteousness and truth.

              <h6>We Believe in Salvation Through Jesus Christ</h6>

                We believe that salvation is a gift of grace, received through
                faith in Jesus Christ. It is not earned by works, but freely
                given to all who believe and confess Him as Lord. Through His
                death and resurrection, we are forgiven, made new, and restored
                into right relationship with God.
